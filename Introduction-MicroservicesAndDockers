Containerization is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image.
The containerized application can be tested as a unit and deployed as a container image instance to the host operating system (OS).
Software containers act as a standard unit of software deployment that can contain different code and dependencies.
Containers also isolate applications from each other on a shared OS. Containerized applications run on top of a container host that in turn runs on the OS (Linux or Windows).
Containers therefore have a significantly smaller footprint than virtual machine (VM) images.
Docker is a container host.
Containers offer the benefits of isolation, portability, agility, scalability, and control across the whole application lifecycle workflow.
